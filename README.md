# Dinner-bot
A discord bot that randomly selects your meal for you!


To add a food to the bot in discord type !f and then the food

Setup:
1. change the bot token (starting with MTA) in config.json and deploy-commands.js with your own bot token
2. change the client id in config.json to your own
3. run deploy-commands.js to register the commands to your bot
4. run index.js to start the bot (:


Note: you will have to edit the banned words list in index.js. just ctrl + f and search "urmum". this is where the banned words should go
