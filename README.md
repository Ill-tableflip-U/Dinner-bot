# Dinner-bot
A discord bot that randomly selects your meal for you!

The pre made bot with this exact code: [https://discord.com/oauth2/authorize?client_id=1081544441430548530&scope=bot](url)
To add a food to the bot in discord type !f and then the food

Setup:
1. change the bot token (starting with MTA) in config.json and deploy-commands.js with your own bot token
2. change the client id in config.json to your own
3. run deploy-commands.js to register the commands to your bot
4. run index.js to start the bot (:


Note: currently if you restart the program then all new user-added meals will be deleted. I will work on a fix.
